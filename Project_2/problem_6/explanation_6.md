# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.
The code should run in O(n) time.
Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.
Sorting usually requires O(n log n) time Can you come up with a O(n) algorithm (i.e., linear time)?


## Data Structure


## Efficiency
### Time
Time Complexity = O(n): The given list is run through once and min and max values are kept track of.

### Space
Space Complexity = O(1): The additional memory allocated is independent of the list given.
There are two variables min_element and max_element for which a constant amount of space in the size of one integer is 
reserved.
