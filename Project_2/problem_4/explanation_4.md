# Dutch National Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, the algorithm shall sort the array in a single traversal. 
That without using a sorting function that Python provides.

The idea behind the algorithm designed, is to work with four ranges: one range for zeros, one range for ones, 
one range for unknown numbers and one range for twos.

## Data Structure


## Efficiency
### Time
Time Complexity = O(n)
As the algorithm only traverses through the input once, the time complexity is O(n).

### Space
Space Complexity = O(1)
No extra space is needed as the list is sorted inplace, hence the space complexity is O(1).
